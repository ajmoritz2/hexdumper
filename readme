This is just a short program I wrote to get the reings of the C language.  Yea
I know it kinda sucks but I'm probably not gonna update it anymore.

There are a few arguments you can put down such as -p for the output file

-r for just the raw ## hex no translation

and thats actually it. There are two more flags in the code but they have no
functionality because I'm too lazy to put it in. Yes this will create the new
file for you. I'm not responsible for any memory leaks or whatever else is
caused by this. Yes you have to build it yourself with gcc or something idc.
The make file is there for you!
